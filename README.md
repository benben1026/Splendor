# Splendor
Splendor is a famous borad game around the world. If you don't know this game, check it out [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splendor_(game)).

This repository is a console version of this board game, and it is implemented by Java. Although it supports multiplayer game, but since there is no GUI, it is not user friendly at all.
The goal for this repository is to train an Splendor AI. Currently it is still under developing. A few APIs will be exposed so that everyone could leverage this repository to train their own AI.
